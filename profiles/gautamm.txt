League Fraud: gautamm (10-4)

	Their 10-4 record and first-seed playoff position suggest dominance. But beneath that record lies a statistical profile that raises significant questions about merit.

	gautamm was expected to win 7.4 games based on their scoring profile. They won 10. This +2.60 WAIL represents the largest overperformance among all teams.

	Their weekly scoring pattern tells a revealing story:

	Week 2: 198 points

	Week 14: 205 points

	Weeks 3-13: Significant volatility with multiple below-median performances

	This feast-or-famine approach manifests in their 29.2 standard deviation - the highest in the league. gautamm wasn't consistently good; they were inconsistently explosive. But as 3 below-median wins (most among playoff teams), perfect 2-0 in close games, and a 11.01 mean-median gap would tell, lucky on their bad days too. 

	The 11.01 point gap between their mean (147.14) and median (136.13) scores is particularly telling. This indicates their average was significantly inflated by those explosive weeks rather than consistent excellence. When they weren't erupting for 190+ points, they were often barely above league average.

	Either way, you don't get points for style. You get them for winning. And whatever the numbers might say about sustainability or merit, gautamm has weaseled his way to the top of the league.
