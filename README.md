# Glizzy-FF-2024-Dashboard

To host the dashboard locally, input the following into Powershell. 
1. Navigate to the correct file directory first (in my case): cd C:\Users\hoon\Desktop
2. python -m streamlit run fantasy_dashboard.py

It should lead to this message:
      "Welcome to Streamlit!
      If youâ€™d like to receive helpful onboarding emails, news, offers, promotions,
      and the occasional swag, please enter your email address below. Otherwise,
      leave this field blank."

The prompt you're seeing is Streamlit's first-time setup.
Skip the email signup:
  Just press Enter without typing anything. This will skip the email collection and launch your dashboard
